# Training hyperparameters

Note: This repository is an extension of [rl_games](https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games/tree/master) and [isaacgymenvs](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/IsaacGymEnvs) for work on imitation learning agents. Most of the parameters here are also found in the parent repositories. However, this doc provides more detailed definitions of these training hyperparameters and suggestions for their values depending on the task at hand. View the set of params used for training [here](#set-of-params) (please refer to the parent repositories for an exhaustive list of params). The full yaml config can be found in the cfg directory.

For example, with const_initializer, the tensor is initialised to have all elements to this value  NOTE: Most models use exp(sigma) as the covariance matrix of the Gaussian from which actions are sampled. When using const_initializer with fixed_sigma=True, the scale is the value to which the covariance is set and no learning is done. In this case, if scale=0.0 then actions are sampled from a distributions with the learnt mean and identity covariance. This is alright if the environment accepts unnormalised actions. HOWEVER, if the actions are normalised (in range -1,1) in the environment then under this config, learning would be very noisy as the model would only sample actions from the whole action space. Setting it to -ve values is preferred if your actions are normalised in the environment 	|                                                                                                                                                                                                            	|

This ensures that a batch can exactly comprise of whole number mini batches                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       	| https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games/blob/cba782ceb772795628e52a3da3d5dc8c20ecb779/rl_games/common/datasets.py#L8                                                                                           	|
